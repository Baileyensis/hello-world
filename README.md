# hello-world
I am learning about how to use this website.

I have been using R since 2015. I use it primarily to run statistical tests on my research data and to make figures. At the moment I want to literally pull my hair out because I struggle with both statistical concepts AND the coding to make the stats a reality in R. I talk to experts in my field online via Twitter and StackExchange and those interactions just make me want to cry because I have no idea what anyone is talking about and I feel like an idiot.
